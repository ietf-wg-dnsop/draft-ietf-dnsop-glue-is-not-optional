              DNS Glue Requirements in Referral Responses
                draft-ietf-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional-08

Abstract

   The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the
   addresses of name servers that are contained within a delegated zone.
   Authoritative Servers are expected to return all available glue
   records for in-domain name servers in a referral response.  If
   message size constraints prevent the inclusion of all glue records
   for in-domain name servers, the server MUST set the TC flag to inform
   the client that the response is incomplete, and that the client
   SHOULD use another transport to retrieve the full response.  This
   document updates RFC 1034 to clarify correct server behavior.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034], [RFC1035] uses glue records
   to allow iterative clients to find the addresses of name servers that
   are contained within a delegated zone.  Glue records are added to the
   parent zone as part of the delegation process and returned in
   referral responses, otherwise a resolver following the referral has
   no way of finding these addresses.  Authoritative servers are
   expected to return all available glue records for in-domain name
   servers in a referral response.  If message size constraints prevent
   the inclusion of all glue records for in-domain name servers over the
   chosen transport, the server MUST set the TC (Truncated) flag to
   inform the client that the response is incomplete, and that the
   client SHOULD use another transport to retrieve the full response.
   This document clarifies that expectation.

Internet-Draft DNS Glue Requirements in Referral Responses February 2023


   DNS responses sometimes contain optional data in the additional
   section.  In-domain glue records, however, are not optional.  Several
   other protocol extensions, when used, are also not optional.  This
   includes TSIG [RFC8945], OPT [RFC6891], and SIG(0) [RFC2931].

   At the time of this writing, addresses (A or AAAA records) for a
   delegation's authoritative name servers are the only type of glue
   defined for the DNS.

   Note that this document only clarifies requirements of name server
   software implementations.  It does not introduce or change any
   requirements on data placed in DNS zones or registries.  In other
   words, this document only makes requirements on "available glue
   records" (i.e., those given in a zone), but does not make
   requirements regarding their presence in a zone.  If some glue
   records are absent from a given zone, an authoritative name server
   may be unable to return a useful referral response for the
   corresponding domain.  The IETF may want to consider a separate
   update to the requirements for including glue in zone data, beyond
   those given in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Types of Glue in Referral Responses

   This section describes different types of glue that may be found in
   DNS referral responses.  Note that the type of glue depends on the
   QNAME.  A particular name server (and its corresponding glue record)
   can be in-domain for one response and in a sibling domain for
   another.

2.1.  Glue for In-Domain Name Servers

   The following is a simple example of glue records present in the
   delegating zone "test" for the child zone "foo.test".  The name
   servers for foo.test (ns1.foo.test and ns2.foo.test) are both below
   the delegation point.  They are configured as glue records in the
   "test" zone:

      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.foo.test.
      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.foo.test.
      ns1.foo.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.2.1
      ns2.foo.test.              86400   IN AAAA    2001:db8::2:2

   A referral response from "test" for "foo.test" with glue for in-
   domain name servers looks like this:

      ;; QUESTION SECTION:
      ;www.foo.test.       IN      A

      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.foo.test.
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.foo.test.

      ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
      ns1.foo.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.2.1
      ns2.foo.test.           86400        IN      AAAA    2001:db8::2:2

2.2.  Glue for Sibling Domain Name Servers

   Sibling domain name servers are NS records that are not contained in
   the delegated zone itself, but in another zone delegated from the
   same parent.  In many cases, glue for sibling domain name servers are
   not strictly required for resolution, since the resolver can make
   follow-on queries to the sibling zone to resolve the name server
   addresses (after following the referral to the sibling zone).
   However, most name server implementations today provide them as an
   optimization to obviate the need for extra traffic from iterative
   resolvers.

   Here the delegating zone "test" contains two delegations for the
   child zones "bar.test" and "foo.test":

      bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
      bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.
      ns1.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.2.1
      ns2.bar.test.              86400   IN AAAA    2001:db8::2:2

      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.

   A referral response from "test" for "foo.test" with glue for sibling
   domain name servers looks like this:

      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.bar.test.
      foo.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.bar.test.

      ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
      ns1.bar.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.2.1
      ns2.bar.test.           86400        IN      AAAA    2001:db8::2:2

2.3.  Glue for Cyclic Sibling Domain Name Servers

   The use of sibling domain name servers can introduce cyclic
   dependencies.  This happens when one domain specifies name servers
   from a sibling domain, and vice versa.  This type of cyclic
   dependency can only be broken when the delegating name server
   includes glue for the sibling domain in a referral response.

   Here the delegating zone "test" contains two delegations for the
   child zones "bar.test" and "foo.test", and each use name servers
   under the other:

      bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.foo.test.
      bar.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.foo.test.
      ns1.bar.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.2.1
      ns2.bar.test.              86400   IN AAAA    2001:db8::2:2

      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns1.bar.test.
      foo.test.                  86400   IN NS      ns2.bar.test.
      ns1.foo.test.              86400   IN A       192.0.2.3
      ns2.foo.test.              86400   IN AAAA    2001:db8::2:4

   A referral response from "test" for "bar.test" with glue for sibling
   domain name servers looks like this:

      ;; QUESTION SECTION:
      ;www.bar.test.       IN      A

      ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
      bar.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns1.foo.test.
      bar.test.               86400        IN      NS      ns2.foo.test.

      ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
      ns1.foo.test.           86400        IN      A       192.0.2.3
      ns2.foo.test.           86400        IN      AAAA    2001:db8::2:4

   In late 2021 the authors analyzed zone file data available from
   ICANN's Centralized Zone Data Service [CZDS] and found 222 out of
   approximately 209,000,000 total delegations that had only sibling
   domain NS RRs in a cyclic dependency as above.

2.4.  Missing Glue

   An example of missing glue is included here, even though it can not
   be considered as a type of glue.  While not common, real examples of
   responses that lack required glue, and with TC=0, have been shown to
   occur and cause resolution failures.

   The example below is based on a response observed in June 2020.  The
   names have been altered to fall under documentation domains.  It
   shows a case where none of the glue records present in the zone fit
   into the available space of the UDP response, and the TC flag was not
   set.  While this example shows a referral with DNSSEC records
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035], this behavior has been seen with
   plain DNS responses as well.  Some records have been truncated for
   display purposes.  Note that at the time of this writing, the servers
   originally responsible for this example have been updated and now
   correctly set the TC flag.

3.  Requirements

   This section describes updated requirements for including glue in DNS
   referral responses.

3.1.  Glue for In-Domain Name Servers

   This document clarifies that when a name server generates a referral
   response, it MUST include all available glue records for in-domain
   name servers in the additional section, or MUST set TC=1 if
   constrained by message size.

   At the time of writing, most iterative clients send initial queries
   over UDP and retry over TCP upon receiving a response with the TC
   flag set.  UDP responses are generally limited to between 1232 and
   4096 bytes, due to values commonly used for the EDNS0 UDP Message
   Size field [RFC6891], [FLAGDAY2020].  TCP responses are limited to
   65,535 bytes.

Internet-Draft DNS Glue Requirements in Referral Responses February 2023


3.2.  Glue for Sibling Domain Name Servers

   This document clarifies that when a name server generates a referral
   response, it SHOULD include all available glue records in the
   additional section.  If, after adding glue for all in-domain name
   servers, the glue for all sibling domain name servers does not fit
   due to message size constraints, the name server MAY set TC=1 but is
   not obligated to do so.

   Note that users may experience resolution failures for domains with
   cyclically-dependent sibling name servers when the delegating name
   server chooses to omit the corresponding glue in a referral response.
   As described in Section 2.3, such domains are rare.

3.3.  Updates to RFC 1034

   Replace

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  Go to step 4."

   with

   "Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the
   reply.  Put whatever NS addresses are available into the additional
   section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from
   authoritative data or the cache.  If all glue RRs for in-domain name
   servers do not fit, set TC=1 in the header.  Go to step 4."

4.  Security Considerations

   This document clarifies correct DNS server behavior and does not
   introduce any changes or new security considerations.

5.  Operational Considerations

   At the time of this writing, the behavior of most DNS server
   implementations is to set the TC flag only if none of the available
   glue records fit in a response over UDP transport.  The updated
   requirements in this document might lead to an increase in the
   fraction of UDP responses with the TC flag set, and consequently an
   increase in the number of queries received over TCP transport.

8.  Changes

   RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section lists substantial changes to the document as it is being
   worked on.

   From -01 to -02:

   *  Clarified that "servers" means "authoritative servers".
   *  Clarified that "available glue" means "all available glue".
   *  Updated examples and placed before RFC 1034 update.

   From -02 to -03:

   *  Clarified scope to focus only on name server responses, and not
      zone/registry data.
   *  Reorganized with section 2 as Types of Glue and section 3 as
      Requirements.
   *  Removed any discussion of promoted / orphan glue.
   *  Use appropriate documentation addresses and domain names.
   *  Added Sibling Cyclic Glue example.

   From -03 to -04:

   *  Use "referral glue" on the assumption that other types of glue may
      be defined in the future.
   *  Added Operational Considerations section.
   *  Note many current implementations set TC=1 only when no glue RRs
      fit.  New requirements may lead to more truncation and TCP.
   *  Sibling glue can be optional.  Only require TC=1 when all in-
      domain glue RRs don't fit.
   *  Avoid talking about requirements for UDP/TCP specifically, and
      talk more generically about message size constraints regardless of
      transport.

Internet-Draft DNS Glue Requirements in Referral Responses February 2023


   From -04 to -05:

   *  Reverting the -04 change to use the phrase "referral glue".
   *  Rephrase "in-domain glue" as "glue for in-domain name servers".
   *  Rephrase "sibling glue" as "glue for sibling domain name servers".
   *  Expand paragraph noting this document does not make requirements
      about presence of glue in zones.

   From -05 to -06:

   *  More instances of rephrasing "in-domain glue" as "glue for in-
      domain name servers" (and for sibling glue).

   From -06 to -07:

   *  Change "NOT REQUIRED to set TC=1" to "MAY set TC=1 but is not
      obligated to do so."

   From -07 to -08:

   *  Update TSIG reference to RFC8945.
