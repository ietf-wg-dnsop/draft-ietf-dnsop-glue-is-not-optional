        The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to
        find the addresses of nameservers that live within the
        delegated zone.  Glue records are expected to be returned
        as part of a referral and if they cannot be fitted into
        the UDP response, TC=1 MUST be set to inform the client
        that the response is incomplete and that TCP SHOULD be
        used to retrieve the full response.

        The DNS <xref target="RFC1034"/>, <xref target="RFC1035"/>
        uses glue records to allow iterative clients to
        find the addresses of nameservers that live within the
        delegated zone.  Glue records are expected to be returned
        as part of a referral and if they cannot be fitted into
        the UDP response, TC=1 MUST be set to inform the client
        that the response is incomplete and that TCP SHOULD be
        used to retrieve the full response.
      </t>
      <t>
        While not common, real life examples of servers that fail
        to set TC=1 when glue records are available exist and they
        do cause resolution failures.  The example below shows a
        case where none of the glue records, present in the zone,
        fitted into the available space and TC=1 was not set in the
        response.  While this example shows an DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>, <xref target="RFC4034"/>, <xref target="RFC4035"/> referral response, this behaviour has
        also been seen with plain DNS responses as well.  The records
        have been truncated for display purposes.

        This is almost certainly due a wide spread misbelief that
        all additional section records are optional.  This has never
        been the case with respect to glue records and later protocol
        extension have added more cases where records in the additional
        section are not optional in the response.  This includes TSIG <xref target="RFC2845"/>, OPT <xref target="RFC6891"/>, and SIG(0)
        <xref target="RFC2931"/>.

        Glue records are added to the parent zone as part of the
        delegation process.  They are expected to be returned as
        part of a referral and if they can't fit in a UDP response
        TC=1 MUST be set to signal to the client to retry over TCP.
        This document reinforces that expectation.
